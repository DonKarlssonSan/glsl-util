# glsl-util

A mixed bag of glsl functions covering:
- Color blending/compositing, plus blend mode interpolation
- Complex number operators
- Complex plane transforms and transform interpolation
- Procedural texture generation

Originally this was an all-in-one shader for an old app I worked on as a glsl beginner, but now just placed here because it contains some useful functions.
